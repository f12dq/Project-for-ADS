Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB  for the assignement I created this simple app for CRUD operations demonstation.The App is called "FEEDBACKIT" and it is a social web site which allows users to sign up and post their feedback for everyone to see it.

Setup:

run npm install  for both client and server side to start the app:
-cd client then npm install
-cd server then npm install
TO run the project npm start for each side.
